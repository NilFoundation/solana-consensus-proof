\subsection{Validator Set Proof Circuit}

Let $E_1$, $E_2$ are two consecutive epochs. $E_1$ is confirmed on the Ethereum side and $E_2$ is not.

To prove the validator set $S_2$ of $E_2$, the prover does the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item for $i$ from ${v_1, ..., v_m} = S$:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Show the inclusion proof of the last stake-change transaction to $v_i$ (no later than the end of $E_1$).
		\item Show that the there wasn't any stake update since the last delegate transaction $tx_{last}$.
		That means verifying all transactions between $tx_{last}$ and the beggining of $E_2$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Such an approach provides additional overhead to the prover.
The proof of correct validator set will be simplified after implementation of the "Simple Payment and State Verification"\footnote{\url{https://docs.solana.com/proposals/simple-payment-and-state-verification}} proposal.

This leads to the circuit defined as follows:
